## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
library(gutenbergr)
library(textreg)

gutenberg_metadata

gutenberg_works()

gutenberg_download(1184)

download.file(http:/www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/5050/pg5050.txt)


http://www.gutenberg.org/files/5050/5050.txt

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
Washington_1 <- pg5010.txt
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
